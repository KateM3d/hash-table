# Hash Table Console App

This console application allows you to interact with a simple hash table implemented in JavaScript. You can add, remove, count, and check for the existence of key-value pairs in the hash table.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Install the necessary packages (only needed once):

When you run the app, you will be presented with a menu that allows you to perform the following actions:

1 - Add new entry: Add a new key-value pair to the hash table.
2 - Remove: Remove an entry from the hash table by key.
3 - Count: Display the total number of key-value pairs in the hash table.

## Error Handling

The app includes error handling to handle duplicate key entries, removing non-existent keys, and checking for non-existent keys. Any encountered errors will be displayed in the console.

## Features

Hash table functionality is implemented using functional programming, making it easier to read and maintain.
Key-value pairs are stored in a hash table, with keys hashed for efficient storage and retrieval.
The app provides real-time information on the operations you perform.
